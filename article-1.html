      What does it mean to design &#8220;normal&#8221; things for &#8220;normal&#8221; people?

      <p>
        Western society defines certain individuals and communities as average and ordinary, while everyone else is something other. <span class="span2">People living inside the norm bubble often don&apos;t recognize their own special status,</span> because norms aren&apos;t supposed to be special. Synonyms for the word normal include standard, average, typical, and ordinary. Norms are invisible, becoming present only when they rub up against difference.
        <br>
        Graphic designers are in the norm business. We employ legible fonts and familiar interface conventions in order to churn out seemingly neutral, user-friendly messages. We use grids, hierarchies, and tasteful type pairings to unify publications and websites. We produce brand standards and corporate identity manuals to regulate the public image of companies and institutions. Each year, we harvest a fresh crop of sans serif typefaces claiming to deliver content in anonymous, trouble-free text blocks. It&apos;s Helvetica&apos;s world. We just live in it.
